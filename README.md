##Introduction##

Context Profiles is a UI module based on context. What makes context profiles different from similar modules is that it does not create own entities or add functionality, but simply provides an easy way of using context. As a result context profiles can be en/disabled without any affects on your application.

Currently the main focus of context profiles lays on placement of blocks on content entities.

Additionally, this module allows you to organise blocks placed by different contexts on the same page/entity view.

##Configuration##

The module allows you restrict block providers and regions on a role base, so you can select which users can place which blocks in whatever region.

###Additional###
Context profiles includes a Tour.

This module has not been fully tested, making it unsuitable for larger production websites.#
